	Ghost ('G'): This is both an interacting and moving piece. 
	It moves around randomly using the Random number generator. 
	If the player encounters the ghost, it takes a hit. 

	Gnome ('o'): This is not a child of gamepiece. It only implements Drawable.
	It does not interact with the player.

	When the player lands here, the player receives a point.
